Spanish Conjugation Dictionary v1.3
Miles de la Hunty
May 2011

This dictionary provides quick-reference conjugation tables for 11,500 Spanish verbs. It uses the Stardict format, but to my knowledge only renders correctly with the Goldendict dictionary program by Konstantin Isakov, available at http://http://goldendict.org/ for Windows and Linux. To install, copy this entire directory somewhere Goldendict can find it.

Note that all compound tenses, the subjunctives in -se and -re, and the entire "imperative" mood apart from the second person are omitted for compactness; these are easily deduced from the forms provided. There are also no definitions given! There are other dictionaries for that.

To the best of my knowledge the tables are accurate, but they are machine-generated and it goes without saying that you should not rely on their correctness where harm might result. If you do find any errors, or have suggestions for features or other verbs for inclusion, please do email me at <miles.dlh@gmail.com>.
